# Probability-Theory-Statistical-Sampling-Algorithms

I'm really interested in how distributions are represented/approximated. I've learned about and will implement advanced sampling algorithms and perhaps find some creative applications.  
My Goals: Metropolis-Hastings (of which Gibbs is a special case), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (continuous distributions), Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation (TRW-BP), Graph Normalizing Flows, and beyond!
