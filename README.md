# Probability-Theory-Statistical-Sampling-Algos

I'm really interested in how probability distributions are represented/approximated and how computational linear algebra techniques play into it. I've learned about and will implement advanced sampling algorithms and perhaps find some creative applications. 

My Goals: Metropolis-Hastings (of which Gibbs is a special case), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (continuous distributions), Single-Value Decomposition & Spectral Theorem (Spectral Clustering), Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation (TRW-BP), Graph Normalizing Flows, and beyond!
